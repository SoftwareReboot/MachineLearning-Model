## 📚 Overview

This project showcases practical implementations of machine learning concepts learned during our university studies.  
Each notebook or script in this repository represents a distinct project focusing on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Models Included

- **Car Purchasing Model** (`Car Purchasing Model.ipynb`)  
  Predicts how much a customer is willing to spend on a new car using demographic and behavioral data.  
  Techniques used: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and feature scaling.

- **Decision Tree Model** (`Decision Tree.ipynb`)  
  Implementation and improvement of a Decision Tree classifier/regressor on various datasets such as customer and loan data.

- **Customer Profile Model** (`Customer.csv`, `loan.csv`)  
  Focused on predicting customer behavior patterns and financial decisions using supervised learning methods.
