 📚 Overview

This project demonstrates **hands-on implementations** of key machine learning concepts learned throughout our studies.  
Each notebook or script represents a distinct project that focuses on:
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training  
- Performance evaluation and visualization  

The goal is to create an organized and educational collection of ML projects that can serve as reference materials for future learning and development.
